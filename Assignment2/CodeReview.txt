Meaningful Names
Problems:
Different naming conventions were applied on the class attributes. (daysActive vs. loan_value)
Clumsy, confusing naming convention for functions. ("public double loan()" - is it a setter? a getter? just a method? what does it do?
Solutions:
Will change the name of attributes and methods based on what they represent or what they compute, by giving them clean, straightforward and explicative names.
