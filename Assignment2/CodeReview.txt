Meaningful Names
Problems:
Different naming conventions were applied on the class attributes. (daysActive vs. loan_value)
Clumsy, confusing naming convention for functions. ("public double loan()" - is it a setter? a getter? just a method? what does it do?
Solutions:
Will change the name of attributes and methods based on what they represent or what they compute, by giving them clean, straightforward and explicative names.


Classes

Solutions: Will divide the class into multiple classes, interfaces, enums

The class did not Override the toString() method but it had a new one created ("to_String()") => will delete this method and override the toString() method.
The class had a useless method: print() => will delete the method.
Will move the constructor right after the attributes of the class.
Deleted the temp variable inside the calculate() function. Simplified the formula.
