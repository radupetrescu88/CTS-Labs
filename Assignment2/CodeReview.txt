Meaningful Names
Problems:
Different naming conventions were applied on the class attributes. (daysActive vs. loan_value)
Clumsy, confusing naming convention for functions. ("public double loan()" - is it a setter? a getter? just a method? what does it do?
Solutions:
Will change the name of attributes and methods based on what they represent or what they compute, by giving them clean, straightforward and explicative names.


Classes
Problems: There is only one big class with several attributes and functions
Solutions: Will divide the class into multiple classes, interfaces, enums

Functions
Problems: The getters also print values => will create separate functions for printing.
Solutions:

Comments
Problems:
Solutions:

Formatting
Problems: The code was not formatted
Solutions: CTRL + A => CTRL + Shift + F

Exceptions
Problems: 
Solutions: Added custom exceptions with meaningful names.

Other problems:
The class did not Override the toString() method but it had a new one created ("to_String()") => will delete this method and override the toString() method.
The class had a useless method: print() => will delete the method.
Will move the constructor right after the attributes of the class.
Deleted the temp variable inside the calculate() function. Simplified the formula.
Some functions were using this and some were not. Added it when necessary even though it was not wrong before.
